# peasy-SFJ
An easier way to connect to SQL databases and extract data from them, written in Java.

Why? 
JDBC is easy, I know. But what happens when you don't know the table or column names? JDBC can solve these problems.

peasy-SFJ (SQL for Java) is an easier way to access data from the databases when you don't know of the columns or tables. Or what type of data you want to access. All you need is, the database location and the authorisation information, as per need.
